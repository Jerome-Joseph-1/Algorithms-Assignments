# Visualizing the Problem

Think of this like building a rectangle. The width of the rectangle is the length of the subarray (from index \(i\) to \(j\)), and the height is determined by the smallest number in that subarray. Our goal is to find the rectangle with the largest area that includes the specific position \(k\).

# Step-by-Step Strategy

### Start Small

Start with the smallest possible subarray, which is just a single point at index \(k\). This means both \(i\) and \(j\) are equal to \(k\). At this point, the initial rectangle has a width of 1 and a height equal to the value of the element at \(a[k]\).

### Expand Wisely

To maximize the area, we need to expand this rectangle. Expanding involves increasing the width by either moving left (decreasing \(i\)) or moving right (increasing \(j\)). However, expanding comes with a catch: while the width of the rectangle increases, the height might decrease since the height is determined by the smallest value in the current range. Therefore, the key is to expand in such a way that the minimum value in the range remains as high as possible for as long as possible. (We can just focus on maintaining the highest possible minimum value, since expanding the subarray to the left or to the right will always increase its length by 1.)

### Choosing the Direction

When deciding whether to move left or right, it's crucial to consider the values just outside our current subarray. Suppose we have a choice to extend left to include the element at \(a[i-1]\) or to extend right to include the element at \(a[j+1]\). The decision should be based on a comparison between these two values:
- If the element at \(a[j+1]\) is larger, we extend the rectangle to the right. This is because a larger value will not reduce our minimum value significantly, helping to maintain a taller rectangle.
- Conversely, if the element at \(a[i-1]\) is larger, we extend to the left. This keeps the rectangle taller by ensuring the smallest number in the range decreases as slowly as possible.
- This strategy helps to keep the "height" of our rectangle (the minimum value within the current range) as high as possible for the longest possible range.

### Continue Until No Options Remain

Continue expanding in the chosen direction until it's no longer possible to do so. If we reach a point where we can no longer move in one direction (for instance, if \(i = 0\) and we can't go left anymore), we continue expanding in the other direction until all possibilities are exhausted. By doing so, we ensure that we have explored all potential rectangles that include the bar at position \(k\) and have found the one with the maximum area.
